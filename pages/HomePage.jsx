            <h1>Rent my yard + grill</h1>
            <p>Tired of trying to grill your food with the windows open in you apartment, we know living in a big city like Miami can be crowded with a little to none outdoors, but we have a solution.
            RENT A YARD.
            Our idea is simple, for those property owners with the extra space why not monetize your outdoor space by renting your yard + plus your grill.

Our network of yards includes a variety of sizes and types, from small backyard patios to large event venues. 
Put your outdoor spave to work for you </p>
